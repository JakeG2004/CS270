# C Compiler
* Invoke the C compiler using `cc` or `gcc` in Linux / Unix systems.
* If the source file is properly written, an executable program (`a.out`) is generated by default. Other output files can be generated using command line options (e.g. assembly or object);
* What happens inside the `cc` / `gcc` command?

## C Language Processing
* file.c -> cpp (C pre processor, **NOT** C++) -> file.i -> c1 (C compiler) -> file.s -> as (assembler), libc, user libraries, other modules -> file.o -> ld (linker) -> a.out

### The Process
* C file (hello.c)
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

* Compile (generate asm)
    * `gcc -S hello.c`

* Assemble the assembly source (from C source)

* Make an executable

## Internal things
### ELF - Executable and Linkable Format
* The executable and linkable format is a common standard file format for executable files, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps
