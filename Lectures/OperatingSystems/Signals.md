# Signals

*Signals* are software interrupts that send information about an occurence of an asynchronous event to an executing program or process. Signals are generated for a variety of reasons such as timer expiration. Most hardware traps - illegal instructions, access to invalid address, and so on - are converted to signals.

Signals can be generated by the process itself, ot they can be sent form one process to another. A variety of signals can be generated or delivered, and they have many uses for programmers.

Operating system signals have quite a history of design changes in the signal code and various implementations of UNIX. This was due in part to some deficiencies in the early implementation of signals, as well as the parallel development done on different versions of UNIX, primarily BSD, UNIX, and AT&T System V.

Every signal has a unique signal name, an abbreviation begins with `SIG` and a corresponding signal number.
