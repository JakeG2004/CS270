# Shells
Command line interface to system

Many types of shells
    * zsh
    * bash
    * fish

All of these shells share a common core set of operations that make life in the Linux system easier. For example, all shells allow the output of a process to be stored in a file or "piped" to another process.

The shell you use is a matter of personal taste.

`chsh` allows you to change your default login shell

## Useful commands
`echo` - displays all of its arguments to standard output, appends newline.
`cd` - change directory
